    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A pretzel dough may not be your first thought when you want to make a pizza, but it's the perfect way to try something new. And if you are both a fan of soft pretzels and pizza, you’ve come to the right place. <br><br>

        Just like any pizza, this one can really be made with whatever sauce and toppings you want. While this recipe uses a cheese sauce as the base, and more mozzarella on top for good measure, a tomato sauce is always an option. If a little heat sounds nice, add chopped pickled jalapeno chiles to the cheese sauce.
        
        Dough for soft pretzels differs from traditional pizza dough in one main way: Pretzel dough gets a baking soda, lye, or malt syrup wash to create the signature “pretzel flavor” and the crunchy brown crust. A proper pretzel will be made with a traditional lye bath, which gives the snack its deep brown color and signature flavor. Considering lye can be dangerous if handled improperly, a baking soda bath, which this recipe uses, can create a very similar result.</p>
